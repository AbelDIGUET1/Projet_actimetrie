This repository contains an actimetric project about a connected healthcare watch for stroke (AVC) monitoring.
The project was developed in a group as part of a university engineering project at Polytech Montpellier.

You will find in this repository the project report, the final presentation slides, schematics, and different versions of the code developed during the project.
The code allows the operation of both the watch and the bracelet, including corrected and improved versions.
